# Music
Summary of Tasks 1-4 of Python Music Project

We are a team of 3 students from the ISE department of Ramaiah Institute of Technology, currently studying in Semester 4. We are working on a Music-related Python project with faculty from Ramaiah Institute of Applied Sciences and have so far completed the following tasks.

1.	Task 1- HMM
We debugged and implemented the code for Hidden Markov Model on Google Colab.
The results were then interpreted on running the code for specified inputs.
2.	Task 2- Sequence Learning
We understood the application of Sequence Learning and tried implementing the seqlearn code on Google Colab. However, we were not able to arrive at the desired output and have kept this task on standby for the time being.
3.	Task 3- Seq2Seq Model
This task involved implementing a google translate like-model that converts German to English. We understood and implemented the Seq2Seq model using Pytorch 1.8, TorchText 0.9, spaCy 3.0 and Python.
4.	Task 4- Music Genre Classification
Attempted to classify music into 10 different genres using Hidden Markov Models. The model that was trained comprised of 1000 tracks- 100 tracks belonging to each genre. The dataset used is provided by Marsyas. For audio processing, MFCC and filter banks were used.
